Genetic Algorithm Plans:
    -Petri Dish
        -Circular
        -Contains:
            -Food parcels(+1 fitness)
            -Other cells(+2 fitness)
            -Obstacles/walls
                -show how genetic algorithms work around limitations over the course of generations
        -DNA:
            -Series of strings:
                -Movement:
                    -"M:(direction)" ("M:U" == move up)(cost 1 food)
                -Expansion:
                    -"E:(measure)" ("E:L" == expand lengthwise)(cost 1 food)

        TIME ALLOTTED PER TASK:                         ==================================================
            Work on randomizing environments    : 3h    |                                                |
                                                        |   Work on UI throughout this design process    |
            Build and implement GA concepts             |                                                |
            such as DNA, crossover, reprod,     : 5h    ==================================================
            mutation, etc.

            Work on interaction constraints
            such as collisions, FOV(?) and      : 5h
            reading DNA for actions.

            Creating presentable setup
            designed for exact specs for
            our purpose and application like    : 2h
            collecting, displaying, and
            interpreting data.

                                                ~15h
