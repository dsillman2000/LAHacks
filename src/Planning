Genetic Algorithm Plans:
    -Petri Dish
        -Circular
        -Contains:
            -Food parcels(+1 fitness)
            -Other cells(+2 fitness)
            -Obstacles/walls
                -show how genetic algorithms work around limitations over the course of generations
        -DNA:
            -Series of strings:
                -Movement:
                    -"M:(direction)" ("M:U" == move up)(cost 1 food)
                -Expansion:
                    -"E:(measure)" ("E:L" == expand lengthwise)(cost 1 food)
